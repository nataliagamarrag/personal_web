I am currently working on an angular project and one little requirement that I had, depended on a deployment in production, which involves a lot of time.

To save time, the execution of this javascript code is by Google Optimizer, but our framework is Angular, so how we do it?

Angular zone is an execution context that persists across async tasks(Events, XMLHttpRequests, and Timers) and notifies the framework to perform change detection when an asynchronous operation has happened.

Let's get started. ðŸ¤“

First, we add a method that we want to expose in the object window:

``` javascript
declare global {
  interface Window { openMessageAngular: () => void; }
}
```

Next, we need to create a method that calls a run() that allows you to execute a function inside the angular zone.

``` javascript
private showMessageFromWindow() {
  this.zone.run(() => {
    // your logic
    console.log('hola', this.title);
  });
}
```

Now, we pass a reference of the new function with context this in case were necesary:

``` javascript
ngOnInit() {
 window.openMessageAngular = this.showMessageFromWindow.bind(this);
}
```

Let's run the app by using npm start, and view the result.
